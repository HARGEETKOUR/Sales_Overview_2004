# Sales_Overview_2004
## Project Introduction
This project leverages the [Classic Models sample database](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mysqlsampledatabase.zip) to create a dynamic Sales Overview Dashboard in Power BI, for a fictional Company, Classic Models. By integrating SQL, Power BI, and Excel, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, profitability, and customer demographics. The goal of the project is to facilitate data-driven decision-making by visualizing key metrics and trends across product lines, countries, and office locations.

## Key Objectives
**Visualize Sales and Profit Performance**: Track sales, net profit, and cost of sales trends across multiple dimensions.<br>
<br>
**Analyze Product Line Profitability**: Assess profitability by product line, customer demographics, and geographic regions.<br>
<br>
**Interactive Exploration**: Enable easy filtering and drill-down into specific periods, regions, and product categories.<br>
<br>
**Data Optimization**:  Use Excel pivot tables for quick summaries and initial analysis, and SQL to structure data for Power BI.<br>

## Data Source
The Classic Models sample database, which provides data on customers, orders, employees, products, and more, can be downloaded from [Classic Models sample Database](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mysqlsampledatabase.zip).

## Tools and Technologies
**Power BI**: The primary tool for data visualization, creating an interactive and engaging dashboard.<br>
<br>
**SQL**: Used for creating tables and querying data to prepare it for Power BI analysis.<br>

## Analysis Process
**1. Data Gathering and Strategy Development**: The data was gathered from the Classic Models database, and key project questions were defined to guide the analysis in alignment with business goals.<br>

**2. Database Preparation in MySQL Workbench**: Using MySQL Workbench, tables were created within the Classic Models database to structure and manage the data for efficient querying.<br>

**3. Query Optimization with CTEs**: Common Table Expressions (CTEs) were applied to calculate specific fields and simplify query structure, improving readability and execution. A main table was then created to consolidate data for the year 2004, joining necessary tables with SQL commands.<br>

**4. Field Calculations**: The following fields were calculated to enable in-depth profitability and cost analysis:<br>

-Net Profit<br>
-Sales Value<br>
-Cost of Sales<br>

**5. Creating Views for Power BI**: A view was created, consolidating the required data into a table named "Sales Data," optimized for use in Power BI.<br>

**6. Data Export for Excel Analysis**: The consolidated table was exported to Excel, where pivot tables were created to further analyze and summarize net profit across product lines and countries.<br>

**7. Dashboard Development in Power BI**: Using the processed data, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created to present key metrics, profitability, and regional sales trends.<br>

## Dashboard Features<br>
**Slicers**: Slicers are provided for users to filter data by specific time periods, months, and product lines, enabling focused insights based on dynamic selections.<br>

**Navigation**: The dashboard is organized into two pages, with interactive buttons for seamless navigation.<br>

Page 1: Overview of Key Sales Metrics<br>
Page 2: Detailed Profit and Sales Analysis<br>
<br>
**Decomposition Tree**: On the second page, a decomposition tree visualizes net profit by product line, country, and customer. This tree offers a drill-down analysis, allowing users to explore how different dimensions contribute to net profit.<br>

>This dashboard gives Classic Models a robust analytical view of its sales and profitability. Through detailed breakdowns and interactive visuals, it serves as an essential tool for data-driven insights into product performance, customer demographics, and geographic trends.<br>
